1\. 📚Read Philip K. Dick Pay for the Printer (1956) and The Preserving Machine (1953). Write a reflection below:

Both stories made me think about how fragile “civilization” actually is when we rely on one system to keep everything running. In “Pay for the Printer,” the settlements feel comfortable only because the Biltong can copy the old world, and when the copies start coming out “puddinged,” everyone realizes they never learned how to truly make things for themselves. I was most surprised by how quickly people turn desperate and violent in this situation. In “The Preserving Machine,” the attempt to preserve art by turning music into living creatures ends up distorting it, which made me feel like preservation without understanding can ruin the very thing you’re trying to save. Both are very interesting to read.



2\. Connect a concept from [Synthesizing with Moog | Lesson 4: Resonance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spVzRqOsVw) to an aspect of the interface in the [Learning Synth Playground](https://learningsynths.ableton.com/en/playground) by Ableton 

- Your response








3\. 📚Read Chapter 1 Get to know your  Raspberry Pi Pico (8-19) in [Get Started with MicroPython on Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.mclibre.org/descargar/docs/revistas/hackspace-books/hackspace-get-started-with-micropython-on-pico-01-202101.pdf). Read and follow tutorial to install the MicroPython firmware on Pico.

p.20–25 - Read and follow tutorial to install Thonny and run the "Hello, World!" Add documentation below to show you can save and run python code on the Pico.

Showed in class





4\. What is the difference between a microcontroller and a regular computer? (Chapter 1)

A microcontroller is a small device built to perform specific control tasks, while a regular computer is a more general-purpose system





5\. 📚Read Chapter 2 (20–33) Programming with MicroPython. Summarize steps to program the Pico from your computer.

Install an IDE and connect the Pico to your computer with a cable, then open Thonny, choose the MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico) interpreter so programs run on the Pico, and write your code in the editor before running or saving it to execute on the microcontroller.




6\. 📚Read Chapter 2: "Challenge: New Message" (26) - You can display programming code in a markdown file using three backticks, a new line, and then three more backticks on the following line. 

```python
print("!")
```


7\. Chapter 2: "Challenge: Loop the Loop" (26)

```python
for i in range(5):
    print("First loop number", i)
    for j in range(3):
      print("Second loop number", j)
```

8\. Chapter 2: "Challenge: Add More Questions" (26)

```python
user_name = input("What is your name? ")
number = int(input("Type a number: "))

print("Hello", user_name)

if number > 5:
    print("Your number is higher than 5.")
elif number < 5:
    print("Your number is lower than 5.")
else:
    print("Your number is exactly 5.")
```






9\. 📚Read Chapter 3 (34–43) Physical Computing. How many Ground pins are on the Pico?

8



10\. Post sketches for your musical instrument concept along with a potential parts list.

Still an early plan, but I want to modify and build on top of the plate reverb project laid out in the textbook.
