1\. 📚 Read Chapter 03 - The Hello World Oscillator (39-45) in [Electronic music from scratch](https://www.makershed.com/products/make-electronic-music-pdf) (Pearson). Write a comment on one of Pearson's phrases that speaks to you. (2-3 sentences) 

- One phrase that speaks to me is “an electronic appliance uses electricity as a language.” I like this idea because it shows that electronics are not just powered by electricity but use it to communicate and create complex results. It makes electronic music and devices feel more creative and expressive, since voltage can be used to send information and shape sound.


2\. Follow instructions in "My First Square Wave Oscillator" experiment (Pearson 59-71) to create a breadboard oscillator. Share a photo.

3\. Create at least one variation on your oscillator inspired by four variations on the circuit. Share a video of your your device.

4\. 📚 Read Chapter 4 - Amps, Reverbs, and Talkboxes (72-75) in [Electronic music from scratch](https://www.makershed.com/products/make-electronic-music-pdf) (Pearson). 




5\. Once you start listening you'll hear it everywhere. Share a link to a song that uses a synthesizer below.

6\. Watch Synthesizer Basics: Amplitude, Oscillators, Timbre and describe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3udLCvoCC0 

Amplitude: The height of a sound wave that controls how loud or soft a sound is.

Oscillators: Components in a synthesizer that create sound by producing repeating electronic waves.

Timbre: The distinct quality or color of a sound that makes it different from other sounds, even when they have the same pitch and volume.




7\. What is the difference between an analog and digital component?

An analog component works with continuous signals that can change smoothly over time, like natural sound waves. A digital component works with discrete signals, usually in the form of numbers or binary code



8\. [👉Activity: Analyze square waveforms with an oscilloscope](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G4jdcr8KzWpIiIduQyFiQJEG-PFJHpovJb9rWhxhNYw/edit?slide=id.g3b8d920f8b7_0_49#slide=id.g3b8d920f8b7_0_49). On the Snap-on Waveform demo board, which pot controls variable voltage (duty cycle) and which controls variable frequency (PWM slides)? What is a common use of each? 

 Part 8: Variable voltage
 Part 13: Frequency





9\. Post a photo of your Snapon board testing.

10\. 🎬 Watch [Synthesizing with Moog - Lesson 3: Vibrations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VFJzY_GfJU) (14:33). How might you change your square wave to get a triangle wave?
