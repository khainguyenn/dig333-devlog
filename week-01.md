1\. Follow the [class presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G4jdcr8KzWpIiIduQyFiQJEG-PFJHpovJb9rWhxhNYw/edit?slide=id.g10e831bd841_0_47#slide=id.g10e831bd841_0_47) to create a functioning circuit on Tinkercad and link to it here.

- Link to your (publicly-accessible) https://tinkercad.com file

https://www.tinkercad.com/things/eIeenTEYTip/editel?returnTo=%2Fdashboard&sharecode=iHxm8P26jOJrA6-TRXnSX-ophSj_wDxAeRbnySIJlRs

2\. Share your maths using Ohm's law to find the resistor value for your Tinkercad circuit.

(9V - 2V) / -.2A = 350Ω



3\. 📚 Read Chapter 01 - A People's History of Electronic Music (2-14) and Chapter 02 - Musical Electricity for Electrophobes (15-up to 38) in [Electronic music from scratch](https://www.makershed.com/products/make-electronic-music-pdf) (Pearson). Write a comment on one of Pearson's phrases that speaks to you. (2-3 sentences) 

- One phrase that stood out to me is Pearson’s idea that “music technology is the act of finding musical applications for apparently nonmusical things.” This means that music can be made from anything, not just traditional instruments or expensive equipment. It shows that creativity comes from experimenting with everyday objects and technologies, and that anyone can make music



4\. Explore Ishkur’s Guide to Electronic Music 2.0 https://music.ishkur.com/ referenced by Pearson. Describe the influence of one genre from this guide on your current musical listening habits. `(2-3 sentences)`

- One genre from the guide that influences my listening habits is indie electronic, especially chill-out music. A song like *“British Summertime”* by Ultramarine has a calm and atmospheric sound, with soft beats and gentle melodies that create a relaxed mood. This type of music is easy to listen to while studying or unwinding, so it has become part of my regular playlist.



5\. 🎬 Watch this introduction to [Synthesizing with Moog - Lesson 1: Listening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waN4owHeyaQ) (15:33). Describe one of Robert Moog's contributions to electronic music.

Robert Moog played an important role in bringing synthesizers into mainstream music. He developed voltage-controlled synthesizers that could be played more like traditional instruments, making them easier for musicians to use.


6\. The Moog video references ideas also presented in Pearson's "Speaker as microphone" experiment (p.37) explain what a microphone, a speaker, and the human ear have in common? (2-3 sentences) 

A microphone, a speaker, and the human ear all work with sound vibrations. A microphone and the human ear take sound from the air and turn it into signals that can be heard or understood, while a speaker does the opposite by turning signals into sound. They all depend on movement and vibration to create or receive sound.


7\. 🎬 Explore cinematic scores and other works created by [Wendy Carlos](https://www.google.com/search?q=wendy+carlos+filmography) using a Moog. Paste a link to an online example and describe what you like about the composition, performance, connection to themes in the film, etc. (2-3 sentences) 

Wendy Carlos uses the Moog sound in *The Shining* to create a slow tempo that still feels urgent. Combined with the visual effects of the vast, wild mountain landscape, it makes viewers feel uneasy and creates a strong sense of impending doom.
